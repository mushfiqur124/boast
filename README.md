## üõ†Ô∏è Development Journey

This project was **initially prototyped using Lovable** for rapid iteration and feature exploration, then **brought into Cursor for advanced development** and fine-tuning. This hybrid approach allowed for:

- **Rapid prototyping** with Lovable's AI-assisted development
- **Detailed customization** and advanced features in Cursor
- **Best of both worlds**: Speed + precision

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theming
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time features)
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Notifications**: Sonner toasts

## üìä Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **competitions**: Main competition instances with unique codes
- **teams**: Team data (2 teams per competition) with captains and scores
- **participants**: Individual players assigned to teams
- **activities**: Competition events (team-based or individual scoring)
- **scores**: Results tracking with support for both team and individual scores

### Key Relationships
- Competition ‚Üí Teams (1:many)
- Teams ‚Üí Participants (1:many)
- Competition ‚Üí Activities (1:many)
- Activities ‚Üí Scores (1:many)
- Scores can link to either Teams or Participants

## üéÆ How to Use

1. **Create a Competition**: Set up a new competition with a unique code
2. **Add Participants**: Build your draft pool with all players
3. **Draft Teams**: Designate captains and use the coin flip + draft system
4. **Set Up Activities**: Add team or individual activities for your event
5. **Configure Scoring**: Set up scoring rules and bonuses
6. **Compete & Score**: Enter results as activities are completed
7. **Track Progress**: Monitor live leaderboards and transparent scoring

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

### Setup
```sh

npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Setup

**‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED: Supabase Configuration**

This app requires Supabase credentials to function. You must set up your environment variables:

```sh
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your Supabase credentials
# VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
# VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

**Getting Supabase Credentials:**
1. Create a free account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí API 
4. Copy your Project URL and anon/public key
5. Add them to your `.env` file

**Security Notes:**
- Database migrations are in `supabase/migrations/`
- **Never commit .env files to version control**
- Environment variables are required - no fallback credentials for security
- Always use your own Supabase project for development
